# Changelog

## 0.3.0

- Registers now display as unsigned hex/decimal/binary (previously gdb's raw signed default,
  e.g. `0xffffffff` read as `-1`), and hovering any x86-64 register alias in source while
  debugging (`eax`, `al`, `r8w`, `sil`, etc.) shows its current value the same way.
- Register values can now be edited directly — from the Registers panel, or from a Watch entry.
  Accepts decimal, `0x../0b..`, and the asm-style `..h` hex suffix; a negative decimal wraps to
  the register's own two's-complement bit pattern.

## 0.2.4

- Compiler auto-detection now also checks well-known install directories not on `PATH`
  (`~/.local/bin` on Linux/macOS, plus Homebrew's paths on macOS and scoop/chocolatey's shim
  directories on Windows), fixing diagnostics/build/debug silently not finding fasm2/fasm1 when
  VS Code is launched in a way that doesn't inherit your shell's `PATH` additions.

## 0.2.3

- Fixed: `FASM: Debug` could fail with "Could not find the task 'fasm: Debug build (active file)'"
  when starting a session any way other than with the target `.asm` file focused (e.g. from the
  Run and Debug panel) — the debug build now runs directly instead of depending on VS Code's
  task-label lookup.
- Fixed: diagnostics silently produced nothing, with no explanation, when no fasm2/fasm1 compiler
  could be resolved on `PATH`; now logs a warning explaining what's missing.
- Fixed: a document diagnosed before workspace indexing finished (so its real entry point
  couldn't be found yet) was never re-diagnosed once indexing completed.

## 0.2.2

- Fixed: diagnostics for an already-saved file were compiling from last-saved disk content
  instead of the live editor buffer, so unsaved edits (including to a fragment included by a
  different entry file) wouldn't be flagged until the file was saved.

## 0.2.1

- No functional changes; fixes the publish workflow (previous tag failed CI validation).

## 0.2.0

- Completion, hover, go-to-definition, and diagnostics now recognize `format`/`segment`/`section`
  sub-keywords (e.g. `ELF64`, `executable`, `readable`, `DLL`) and operand-size/addressing
  qualifiers (e.g. `byte`, `dword`, `ptr`, `near`) as first-class symbols.

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

- Syntax highlighting, language configuration, and snippets for fasm2/fasmg, with source
  compatibility for classic fasm1.
- Completion and hover for instructions, registers, directives, and your own labels/macros/
  constants; go-to-definition, find-references, rename, and workspace symbol search, backed by a
  background workspace index that stays fast on real-sized projects.
- Live diagnostics from the real fasm2/fasm1 compiler, including for unsaved buffers.
- Signature help for macro calls.
- `FASM: Build`, `FASM: Build and Run`, `FASM: Run`, and automatic compiler discovery with a
  status-bar picker.
- `FASM: Debug` — a real debugger for fasm2 binaries, driving gdb/lldb over their machine
  interface, with an address-to-source-line map built from an injected listing macro (fasm2 emits
  no DWARF/CodeView by default). Breakpoints, stepping, and register inspection; fasm1 isn't
  supported by the debugger yet (its native listing format differs and wasn't verified against a
  real fasm1 install).
